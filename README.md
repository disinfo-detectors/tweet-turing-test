## About the Project
As our capstone project for our respective Master of Science in Data Science degrees, our team is working to determine ways to detect disinformation on Twitter using machine learning and natual language processing techniques.

### Status
Development for this project has largely been completed. Data acquisition and pre-processing was completed during Q4 CY2022, while analysis and modeling has been completed during Q1 CY2023.

Due to the [expected end of Twitter's no-cost Academic Research API access level (science.org)](https://www.science.org/content/article/twitters-plan-cut-free-data-access-evokes-fair-amount-panic-among-scientists), our group does not expect to be able to acquire additional Twitter data in the future. For this and other reasons, it is not likely our group will be able expand this project further.

We do plan to explore publishing our findings.

## Requirements

### Environment
The environments used for this project have:
- Python 3.7+
- Support for Jupyter notebooks
- For modeling: an attached CUDA-enabled GPU with at least 8GB VRAM

### Packages
The Python packages listed below are used to accomplish various portions of our project. Additional packages from the Python standard library are used but are not listed here.
- [Demoji](https://pypi.org/project/demoji/) (for parsing emoji characters)
- [ftfy](https://pypi.org/project/ftfy/) (for cleaning text)
- [multimodal-transformers](https://github.com/georgian-io/Multimodal-Toolkit) (for BERT+tabular transformer modeling)
- NLTK (for natural language processing)
- Numpy (to complement Pandas)
- Pandas (for much of the heavy lifting)
- Pyarrow (for Apache Parquet support)
- [pynvml](https://pypi.org/project/pynvml/) (for monitoring GPU usage during training)
- [regex](https://pypi.org/project/regex/) (for regular expressions)
- [scikit-learn](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-learn/) (for ML utilities)
- Seaborn + Matplotlib (for visualization)
- [Squarify](https://pypi.org/project/squarify/) (for Treemap visualizations)
- [tldextract](https://pypi.org/project/tldextract/) (for parsing URL text)
- [ðŸ¤— Transformers](https://pypi.org/project/transformers/) (for fine-tuning and using BERT)
- [tweet-counter](https://github.com/nottrobin/tweet-counter) (for more accurately counting Tweet character lengths)
- [vaderSentiment](https://pypi.org/project/vaderSentiment/) (for sentiment analysis)
- [wordcloud](https://pypi.org/project/wordcloud/) (for word cloud visualizations)
- [xgboost](https://pypi.org/project/xgboost/) (for ML modeling)

We have setup portions of our code to be run on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resources like Dataproc.
In support of that, additional Python packages are required when executing code within GCP:
- Google Cloud Client Libraries (Storage, Authentication)
- Spark/PySpark (included with Dataproc) - note that while we tested portions of our project with PySpark, we did not include any Pyspark code in the final version.

## Notebook Layout / Project Flow

Our project's code is largely contained within Jupyter notebooks. Each notebook serves a specific purpose, building upon upstream notebooks and passing their progress along to downstream notebooks. The relative layout and overall flow of our project notebooks is summarized in the diagram below.
